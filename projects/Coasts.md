title: 36 Views of Coasts
description: >
  Coasts has been shot over the last 15 years. The original idea for the project was an attempt to make an honest portrait of the coastline itself - the divide between land and sea. Over time I have come to appreciate that it’s not just home. It’s where two worlds meet, conflict, destroy, and create. The line itself exists only in the moment. Coasts are defined by where they have been, and where they can be.
